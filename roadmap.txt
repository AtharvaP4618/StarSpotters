That’s an excellent mindset — *learning by building* is how real developers level up fast. Since you want to **learn backend, scraping, and data science** on the go, I’ll structure everything to help you grow step-by-step **without overwhelming you**.

## 💻 Your Personalized Tech Stack (Industry-Ready & Beginner-Friendly)

| Layer         | Tool/Tech                      | Why? |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------|
| **Frontend**  | React + Tailwind CSS           | Clean UI, responsive, modern. |
| **Backend**   | **FastAPI**                    | Fast, easy to learn, Python-based. |
| **Database**  | **PostgreSQL** with SQLAlchemy | SQL is industry standard. Use ORM to simplify queries. |
| **Web Scraping** | `BeautifulSoup` + `requests` | Beginner-friendly. Add `Selenium` later if needed. |
| **Data Science** | `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `Prophet` | For data cleaning, prediction, visualization. |
| **Deployment** | **Render** or **Railway** + **Vercel** | Free-tier friendly + easy deployment. |
| **Maps & Geo** | Mapbox or Leaflet + OpenStreetMap | Visualize dark sky locations. |

## 🚀 Phase-Wise Roadmap (6–8 weeks total — pace it your way)

---

### ✅ **Phase 1: Setup & Learn the Basics (Week 1)**
**Goal:** Setup the environment and understand the skeleton.

- ✅ Setup your GitHub repo and create project folders:
  ```
  astrospotter/
  ├── frontend/ (React)
  ├── backend/ (FastAPI)
  ├── scraper/ (Python scripts)
  ├── db/ (PostgreSQL schema)
  └── docs/
  ```

- ✅ Learn & install:
  - React + Tailwind (just a simple landing page)
  - FastAPI basics (`GET`, `POST`, simple API)
  - PostgreSQL (connect using SQLAlchemy)

🧠 *Learning Resources* (don’t deep dive, just skim as you build):
- [FastAPI Crash Course – freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA)
- [React & Tailwind Setup](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

---

### 🌠 **Phase 2: Web Scraping (Week 2–3)**
**Goal:** Fetch astronomical events + light pollution data.

- ✅ Choose 1 or 2 reliable sources:
  - [https://in-the-sky.org/](https://in-the-sky.org/)
  - [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
  - [Light Pollution Map](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/)

- ✅ Write simple scrapers:
  - Get event name, date, visibility, and location.
  - Store in JSON or CSV initially.

- ✅ Optional: Add cron job (or FastAPI background task) to auto-update every day/week.

🧠 *Tools:*
- `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `schedule`

---

### 🌍 **Phase 3: Backend + Database (Week 4)**
**Goal:** Build APIs to serve scraped data to frontend.

- ✅ Setup FastAPI project structure.
- ✅ Connect to PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.
- ✅ Define models for:
  - Events
  - Locations
  - Visibility Score

- ✅ Create API routes:
  - `/events/`
  - `/locations/`
  - `/recommendations/`

🧠 *Mini Goals:*
- Use Postman to test APIs.
- Write clean JSON response schemas.

---

### 🧠 **Phase 4: Data Analysis & Scoring (Week 5)**
**Goal:** Build logic to recommend best stargazing times & locations.

- ✅ Use:
  - **Light pollution** (lower = better)
  - **Cloud cover** (scrape or API)
  - **Moon phase** (API or compute)
  - **Event rarity** (if rare, boost score)

- ✅ Combine factors into a **Stargazing Score** (0–100).

- ✅ Add a `/best-spots?lat=..&lon=..` API endpoint.

🧠 *Bonus Skill:*
- Use `Prophet` to forecast clear nights.
- Plot weekly score trends per location.

---

### 🧭 **Phase 5: Frontend Integration (Week 6)**
**Goal:** Display the events, maps, and recommendations.

- ✅ Use React to build:
  - Home page with next celestial events.
  - Map view with best spots near the user.
  - Stargazing score meter.

- ✅ Use Mapbox/Leaflet to render locations.
- ✅ Fetch data from FastAPI using `axios`.

🧠 *Keep it clean:* Use cards, charts, and date pickers to make it feel premium.

---

### ☁️ **Phase 6: Deploy & Polish (Week 7–8)**
**Goal:** Make it live!

- ✅ Deploy backend on **Render** or **Railway**.
- ✅ Deploy frontend using **Vercel**.
- ✅ Connect with domain if you want (from Netlify or Freenom).
- ✅ Polish UI and handle edge cases.

---

## 🧠 Learning Tips:
- Google errors as they happen — you’ll retain better.
- Keep a `README.md` updated from day 1 — good for your resume and interviews.
- Push to GitHub every 2–3 days.
- Break features into **small goals per day** — consistency wins.
