## 🌌✨ **AstroSpotter: Personalized Stargazing & Celestial Event Planner**

### 🔍 **Problem Statement:**
Most astronomy enthusiasts and photographers struggle to find the *right place* and *right time* to observe celestial events due to light pollution, bad weather, or lack of awareness. There's no unified platform that gives **personalized stargazing opportunities** based on location, event rarity, sky quality, and visibility conditions.

---

### 💡 **Project Goal:**
Create an intelligent web application that:
1. Tracks upcoming celestial events.
2. Analyzes user's location and nearby areas.
3. Scores regions based on **light pollution**, **weather**, and **event visibility**.
4. Recommends **the best time and place to watch**.

### 🧠 Features & Modules

#### 📅 Event Aggregation (from Idea #1)
- Scrape from sources like [In-The-Sky.org](https://in-the-sky.org), NASA, etc.
- Events: meteor showers, eclipses, planetary alignments, ISS flyovers.
- Backend job to update events daily or weekly.

#### 🌌 Light Pollution Mapping (from Idea #4)
- Scrape or use APIs from [lightpollutionmap.info](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/) or VIIRS/World Atlas datasets.
- Map regions with Bortle Scale or brightness index.

#### ☁️ Sky Quality + Weather Integration
- Fetch live weather/cloud cover and moon phase data via APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Meteomatics).
- Combine with pollution and elevation to generate a **“Stargazing Score”**.

#### 🧭 Location-Aware Recommendations
- User inputs their city or GPS location.
- App recommends:
  - Best time to observe tonight or this week.
  - Nearest dark-sky location.
  - Events visible from their area.
- Optional: allow travel radius to suggest nearby rural areas.

#### 🧮 Data Science Component
- Time series analysis: predict best stargazing nights in the next month.
- Cluster similar high-quality observation zones.
- Event rarity scoring based on past frequency.

#### 📱 Bonus Features
- User login & dashboard to bookmark events.
- Notification system (email or Telegram bot).
- Night mode UI with dynamic sky map overlays.
- Blog section auto-summarizing event significance with ChatGPT-style explanation.
