rpose and main features.

2. Events Page (Necessary)
This page is absolutely necessary given your Event Aggregation module. The search results show multiple upcoming astronomical events (Lunar Occultations on April 12 and 16, The Whirlpool Galaxy visibility on April 14, and Mercury's highest altitude on April 19). Users need a centralized catalog of events with:

Event cards with dates, times, and descriptions

Filtering options (by event type, visibility from user's location, etc.)

Event details with viewing tips

3. Recommendations Page (Necessary)
This page is the heart of your app's unique value proposition, combining:

Light pollution data

Weather conditions

Moon phase information

User's location preferences

The "Stargazing Score" you mentioned would be prominently featured here, showing users personalized recommendations for when and where to observe specific celestial events.

Additional Essential Pages
4. Sky Map Page
A dynamic, interactive map displaying:

Light pollution levels (Bortle scale visualization)

Dark sky locations within user's travel radius

Weather overlay showing cloud cover

Elevation data

5. User Dashboard Page
Once you implement user accounts, this becomes essential for:

Saved/bookmarked events

Personal observation history

Notification preferences

Location settings

6. Educational Resources Page
Support users with:

Equipment guides

Astrophotography tips

Constellation identification

Auto-generated explanations of astronomical phenomena

Priority and Implementation Order
First Phase: Home, Events, and Recommendations (your current focus)

Second Phase: Sky Map and User Dashboard

Third Phase: Educational Resources

The Events and Recommendations pages are both necessary because they serve different but complementary purposes - Events shows what's happening in the sky, while Recommendations shows the best times and places to view those events based on personalized factors.
